                <div class="tab__content">
                  A long, long time ago, humanity encountered a mysterious alien entity known as the Traveler. A tremendous, floating sphere, the Traveler helped humanity usher in its Golden Age, sharing the knowledge that let humans explore the galaxy, colonize far-off planets, and develop the sort of technology that let us evolve rapidly as a species.
                  <br><br>
                  All good things come to an end, though, and the Traveler was eventually followed by its enemy, the equally mysterious and entirely destructive entity known as the Darkness. Things went bad quickly, and after the Traveler seemingly sacrificed itself to drive off the Darkness, there was precious little left of the human species. Various alien races began to move in for the kill, colonizing former human settlements and making humanity’s continued existence uncertain at best. Everyone refers to the end of the Golden Age as “the Collapse.”
                  <br><br>
                  Fortunately (for humanity), the Traveler had taken one last action before expending its energies. After fending off the Darkness, the Traveler dispersed its life force – referred to as “Light” – in the form of small, seemingly sentient “ghosts” that sought out the greatest, deceased defenders of humanity and reanimated them as “Guardians.”

                                <li>Collected motes should be banked. Every number of motes banked will summon blockers at the bank of the enemy team.</li>

                                <li>Number of motes banked summon blockers: 5 Motes - Small Blocker, 10 Motes - Medium Blocker, 15 Motes - Large Blocker.</li>
                                <li>If there are 2 or more blockers at the bank of a team, it would drain the bank of the opposing team.</li>

                            safeguard humanity within the Last City against all threats. He oversees all Guardian military operations, 
                            and led the Guardians to victory in both the Taken War and Red War. In the aftermath of both conflicts, Zavala 
                            has become increasingly isolated and reluctant to commit Guardians to conflicts outside of the Last City.</p>

                            Once the disciple of Osiris, Ikora's extensive knowledge of her 
                            field has earned her respect amongst all Warlock Orders. Ikora also oversees The Hidden, 
                            an extensive network of Guardians who serve as the Vanguard's secret intelligence gatherers. 
                            From her position, Ikora helped navigate The Last City's survival against numerous threats, 
                            although her secretive nature sometimes set her at odds with fellow Vanguard leaders and friends Commander Zavala and Cayde-6.</p>

                            his predecessor as Hunter Vanguard. After Andal was murdered by Taniks, the Scarred, whom Cayde was believed to have previously killed, 
                            Cayde took up his friend's post in the Tower despite his hatred of being stuck doing paperwork and unable to go on missions.

                            Saint-14 is an Exo and one of the most famous Titans in the history of The Last City. Partnered with the Ghost Geppetto, 
                            he served as the first Titan Vanguard and was the right hand of the Speaker. After the exile of Osiris and Saint-14's crusades against the Fallen, 
                            Saint-14 disappeared on a mission to Mercury to prevent Osiris from disturbing the Vex. He was later stripped of his Light by the Vex and perished in 
                            the Infinite Forest shortly after documenting his final notes to Osiris, the Speaker, and to The Guardian. However, he was spared of that fate with the 
                            time-traveling intervention of the Guardian that served as his inspiration, 
                            and has since returned to the City to oversee the Trials of Osiris at his old friend's request to prepare the City for the coming Darkness.

                            Osiris is a legendary Warlock and former Vanguard Commander who was exiled from The Last City due to his obsession with the Vex. 
                            During his exile, Osiris continued his research on the Vex and discovered the Infinite Forest on Mercury, which he proceeded to explore to 
                            thwart the Vex's plans for the Solar System. After being aided by The Guardian and Ikora Rey in stopping Panoptes, Infinite Mind, Osiris 
                            reestablished connections with the Last City and continued exploring the Infinite Forest while seeking the means to save Saint-14 from his 
                            death within the Vex machine. After succeeding in saving his partner, 
                            Osiris departed Mercury to gather allies and information about a dark future he saw approaching the solar system.

                            Lord Saladin Forge is a Titan Guardian partnered with the Ghost Isirah and one of two known survivors of the original Iron Lords. 
                            He was one of the founders of the Iron Lords and helped end the Dark Age of Risen Warlords to establish the City Age. 
                            However, most of his comrades perished in a battle to contain SIVA, causing Saladin to dedicate his life to maintaining a watch on the Plaguelands 
                            to ensure SIVA never emerged again while also fighting to protect The Last City from threats. In time, he established the Iron Banner to keep the memory of the 
                            fallen Iron Lords alive and train the new Guardians in the ways of old. When the House of Devils uncovered SIVA and unleashed it upon the Cosmodrome, 
                            Saladin worked with The Young Wolf to end the threat of SIVA for good.

                <!--ABOUT-->
                <div class="tab__content">
                  The story of Genshin Impact takes place in the world of Teyvat which is home to seven major nations: Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma, Sumeru, Fontaine, Natlan, and Snezhnaya. These nations are ruled over by deities known as Archons, part of a group of gods called The Seven. Each Archon is associated with one of the seven elements of Teyvat, which are also reflected in their nation's landscape and culture. For example, the nation of Mondstadt is ruled over by Barbatos the Anemo Archon, and so the element of wind is an important symbol known by its people. Apart from the seven nations, there was the nation of Khaenri'ah that lived independently from the authority of gods.
                  <br><br>
                  Celestia is the main heavenly body that presides over Teyvat and is in direct connection with The Seven. A floating island seen in the sky is believed to be it, allegedly the home to gods and also mortals who have ascended to godhood. Humans that are granted Visions, magical gems that grant bearers the ability to command elemental power, are called "allogenes" — ones with the potential to reach godhood.
                  <br><br>
                  While gods rule, the nations also have their own human governing bodies: the Knights of Favonius to Mondstadt, the Qixing to Liyue, and the Shogunate to Inazuma.
                  <br><br>
                  As Paimon and the Traveler are on their way to Mondstadt, they meet Amber of the Knights of Favonius — she had been scouting monster camps nearby. After brief questioning, she offers to escort the duo to the city after completing her tasks. Later, a dragon dubbed "Stormterror" attacks Mondstadt, and the Traveler gets caught by one of his whirlwinds. The Traveler manages to fend off the dragon and catches the attention of the Knights of Favonius. They become acquainted with other members: Acting Grand Master Jean, Cavalry Captain Kaeya, and resident librarian Lisa. (Amber, Kaeya, and Lisa are the three free playable characters the player would obtain in the game.) The Traveler agrees to help the Knights resolve the ongoing crisis and gains more allies: Venti, a local bard who wants to help the dragon, and wine tycoon Diluc.

                            Her eccentric and off-the-wall personality often leaves people with a negative impression of her.

                  The game begins with Geralt's dream about Kaer Morhen, a demolished witcher school. Yennefer, a sorceress and his love interest, 
                  notifies Geralt of Ciri, a young female witcher in training and their adopted daughter, practicing without his permission. 
                  Geralt finds Ciri and brings her back to Vesemir, her teacher. However, the titular Wild Hunt, a phantom army whose appearance 
                  is the beginning of the end of the world, kidnaps Ciri. While Geralt wakes up, he realizes that it was just a bad dream and he 
                  is still on a journey to find Yennefer with his mentor Vesemir.
                  <br><br>
                  While trying to find Yennefer in the Temerian village of White Orchard, Geralt comes in contact with Nilfgaardian commander named 
                  Peter Saar Gwynlew who tasks him into hunting down a Griffin in exchange for Yennefer's location. Yennefer finds Geralt and Vesemir 
                  after an incident in the tavern and tells Geralt that Emhyr var Emeris, the Emperor of Nilfgaard, has summoned him to Vizima, 
                  the capital of Temeria occupied by Nilfgaard. Along the way to Vizima, Geralt and Yennefer are ambushed by the Wild Hunt 
                  but Yennefer successfully teleports them away. In Vizima, Emhyr tasks Geralt to find the emperor's biological daughter, Ciri, 
                  who has returned with the Wild Hunt, the phantom army that intends to capture her and extract her Elder Blood powers.
                  <br><br>
                  In Velen, Geralt finds the Nilfgaardian spy he was supposed to contact tortured to death by the Hunt. 
                  The spy's notes lead Geralt to Philip Stenger, known as the Bloody Baron, who tasks Geralt to find his wife and daughter 
                  in exchange for information on Ciri. After learning of the Baron's abuse of his wife and dealing with a botchling of 
                  the Baron's miscarried child, the search leads to a fisherman who saw the wife get taken by a Fiend with the daughter 
                  escaping to Oxenfurt. Geralt meets an old acquaintance, sorceress Keira Metz, who leads him to the Ladies of the Wood
                  in the Crookback Bog after running into the Hunt in an ancient elven laboratory. After meeting "Gran" who takes care of 
                  the orphans in the bog, Geralt meets the Crones of the Crookback Bog and completes a task for them, dealing with the Whispering Hollock, 
                  in exchange for Ciri's whereabouts. He also learns that "Gran" is Anna, the Baron's wife, and the Crones are holding her hostage. 
                  Optionally in Velen, Geralt can meet up with Letho (if the player haven't killed him in The Witcher 2), clear a cursed tower for Keira, 
                  and help the Baron to try and free his wife from the Crones, which leads to different outcomes determined by how Geralt dealt with the Whispering Hollock.

                  In Novigrad, Geralt meets with Triss Merigold who instructs him to visit an Oneiromancer, 
                  Corinne Tilly, who can interpret dreams. This leads Geralt to find Whoreson Junior and 
                  rescue Dandelion, who was captured after a failed heist. Geralt finds Junior through the 
                  help of Sigismund Djikstra and King Radovid, who used Junior as a spy in Novigrad. Geralt 
                  and Zoltan Chivay rescue Dandelion from the Witch Hunters, with the help of a doppler 
                  named Dudu and Priscilla, a trobairitz who is Dandelion's love interest. Optionally in Novigrad, 
                  Geralt can assist Triss in helping the mages escape from the witch hunters of Novigrad (leading to a romance with her), 
                  help Dandelion open his cabaret as well as dealing with a serial killer who attacked and nearly killed Priscilla, 
                  and help plot an assassination against Radovid with Djikstra, Vernon Roche, Ves and Thaler.
                  <br><br>
                  In Skellige, Geralt meets with Yennefer at the funeral for King Bran. 
                  At the wake, Geralt and Yennefer steal The Mask of Uroboros from the druid Ermion. 
                  Yennefer has Geralt use the mask in the decimated forest to see visions of the past such as Ciri's arrival 
                  with a mysterious mage and her escape from Skellige. This leads to Lofoten, where Yennefer seeks Skjall, 
                  a man from the village who helped Ciri escape the Hunt. Finding his body in Freya's Garden after Skjall was cast out of Lofoten for cowardice, 
                  Yennefer uses necromancy to get information from him about Ciri. Optionally in Skellige, Geralt can find Crach an Craite's son Hjalmar, 
                  who went to kill an Ice Giant on Undvik, and his daughter Cerys, who went to try and lift the curse on the Jarl of Spikeroog. 
                  Finding both leads to a murderous coup in a ceremony to choose the next king. Geralt's actions during the massacre 
                  leads to whether Hjalmar or Cerys becomes Skellige's ruler (and if the quest isn't done, King Bran's son Svanrige becomes ruler) 
                  and part of the conspiracy gets exposed. Geralt can also help Yennefer undo his wish to a djinn (from the short story The Last Wish), 
                  deciding whether to stay with Yennefer or not.
                  <br><br>
                  Geralt pieces together Ciri's story beginning with her arrival in Skellige, 
                  her escape from the Wild Hunt in the forest, Ciri's elven companion being cursed and her arrival at the Crookback Bog. 
                  After escaping the Crones who try to "eat" her and sell her to the Hunt, she stumbles on a child lost in the bog. 
                  After killing a werewolf, she meets the Bloody Baron and after a race, rescues him from a Basilisk by using magic, which the Hunt can track. 
                  Realizing she has put the Baron and his keep in danger, she leaves for Novigrad to repair a phylactery to help cure her companion's curse, 
                  leading her to contact Whoreson Junior. After participating on a heist involving Djikstra's vault, Ciri, Dandelion, and Dudu are betrayed by Whoreson Junior 
                  and during their escape, Dandelion is captured by the temple guard and Ciri teleports back to Skellige. There, her elven companion rescues her 
                  and tells Skjall to look after her until she is well enough to meet him at Drowned Rock. After the Hunt attacks Lofoten, 
                  Skjall helps Ciri escape with her companion, 
                  who manages to hide her in an inaccessible island. Ciri is then put to sleep by her companion and teleported away, with Skjall seeing Uma, 
                  a deformed creature, a while later.
                  <br><br>
                  Summing up the clues, Geralt leaves in search of Uma, the monstrous baby looking creature who may be the key to finding Ciri. After collecting him from the Bloody Baron's (or his men) who won the creature from a skellige merchant, Geralt takes him to Kaer Morhen after seeing Emyhr in Vizima. There Yennefer and the Witchers help lift the curse on Uma by administering the potions of the infamous Trial of Grasses. Uma transforms into Avallac'h, an Aen Elle elf, from the race Eredin, king of the Hunt, and the Hunt itself are from. Avallac'h reveals that he hid Ciri in the Isle of Mists. Geralt plans to bring her to Kaer Morhen so they can stand against the Wild Hunt when they come after her. After recruiting allies for this fight, Geralt then heads for the Isle of Mists. He finds Ciri in a death like state, looked after by some dwarves. While grieving her "death", Avallac'h's guide awakens her in Geralt's arms. Ciri explains that Eredin is afraid of his world falling into the White Frost, and that he wishes to exploit Ciri's powers to evacuate his people and conquer other realms. Ciri teleports Geralt to Kaer Morhen while the Hunt chases after the duo. The Hunt arrives at Kaer Morhen and in the following attack, Vesemir is killed by Imlerith, a wild hunt general, in trying to protect Ciri from the Hunt. Distraught, she releases all her uncontrollable powers, causing Eredin and the Hunt to retreat, followed by Avallac'h casting a spell rendering Ciri docile. Geralt, Yennefer, Triss, Ciri, and other allies then hold a funeral for Vesemir.
                  Ciri is seething for revenge for the death of Vesemir, and asks Geralt to go to Bald Mountain to kill the one responsible, Imlerith. Geralt challenges Imlerith while Ciri faces against the Crones. While Imlerith is defeated, a single crone escapes with Vesemir's wolf medallion. Geralt and Ciri arrive at Novigrad to help Triss and Yennefer reform the Lodge of Sorceresses to help fight the Wild Hunt. There Geralt rescues Phillpa Eilhart from Djikstra and Margarita from the prison on Oxenfurt. Geralt also travels between worlds with Avallac'h to find Viceroy Ge'els in the world of the Aen Elle and turn him against Eredin, with Corinne Tilly's help. They also learn about the Sunstone, found on Skellige, that can lure Eredin out and trap him into a location. Optionally, Geralt can help follow through with the assassination plot against King Radovid, with Philippa striking the lethal blow; afterwards he must side with Vernon Roche or Djikstra on future plans, resulting in the death of the other. In Skellige, Geralt has Fringilla Vigo freed, and along with Philippa, finds the Sunstone. Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri also visit Avallac'h's lab, learning revelations about the Elder Blood which upsets Ciri, and optionally, Geralt can go with Ciri to rightfully bury Skjall. On Undvik, Avallac'h uses the Sunstone, which draws the Hunt and their fleet out, so Geralt and his allies, along with the Nilfgaard fleet can defeat them. The Hunt then freezes Geralt and the Nilfgaardians, which leads Ciri to free them by battling Caranthir, Eredin's right-hand man and Avallac'h's student. After Ciri breaks the spell, she is wounded and teleports away, upon which Geralt approaches Caranthir and defeats him. On the way to the Hunt's flagship, Ciri is rescued by Crach an Craite's navy but Eredin manages to attack the navy and murder the Crach. Geralt faces off against Eredin in a brutal fight and emerges victorious. In his dying breath, Eredin "reveals" that Avallac'h has Ciri and that he lied to them both. Yennefer then saves Geralt from the hounds of the Hunt and set off to find Avallac'h in the nearby tower. Meanwhile, the Conjunction of the Spheres occurs and numerous monsters and rain of ice is set upon the area leading to the beginning of the White Frost. Inside Geralt confronts Avallac'h who drops his sword and tells him that he was helping Ciri, which Geralt doesn't believe. Ciri then asks Geralt to believe her, that only the Elder Blood can stop the White Frost before it consumes all life on every world, predicted by Ithlinne's Prophecy. After a heated discussion or support Ciri goes through the portal and confronts the White Frost, ending the threat by destroying its source.

                          <hr>
                          <p>Geralt of Rivia was a legendary witcher of the School of the Wolf active throughout the 13th century. 
                            He loved the sorceress Yennefer, considered the love of his life despite their tumultuous relationship, and became Ciri's adoptive father.
                            <br><br>
                            During the Trial of the Grasses, Geralt exhibited unusual tolerance for the mutagens that grant witchers their abilities. 
                            Accordingly, Geralt was subjected to further experimental mutagens which rendered his hair white and may have given him greater speed, strength, and stamina than his fellow witchers.
                            Despite his title, Geralt did not hail from the city of Rivia. 
                            After being left with the witchers by his mother, Visenna, he grew up in their keep of Kaer Morhen in the realm of Kaedwen.

                          <p>Yennefer of Vengerberg, born on Belleteyn in 1173, was a sorceress who lived in Vengerberg, the capital city of Aedirn. 
                            She was Geralt of Rivia's true love and a mother figure to Ciri, whom she viewed like a daughter to the point that she did everything 
                            she could to rescue the girl and keep her from harm.
                            <br><br>
                            She helped advise King Demavend of Aedirn (though was never a formal royal advisor), a close friend of Triss Merigold, and the youngest member of 
                            the Council of Wizards within the Brotherhood of Sorcerers. After its fall, the Lodge of Sorceresses attempted to recruit her, 
                            but they didn't see eye to eye as the Lodge wanted to advance their own political agenda by using Ciri.

                            Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon (better known as Ciri), was born in 1252 or 1253,and most likely during the Belleteyn holiday.She was the sole princess of Cintra, 
                            the daughter of Pavetta and Emhyr var Emreis (who was using the alias "Duny" at the time) as well as Queen Calanthe's granddaughter.

                            After Geralt of Rivia helped lift Duny's curse, Duny asked what reward the witcher would like and Geralt evoked the Law of Surprise, 
                            as it turned out Pavetta was pregnant with Ciri, unbeknownst to Duny. Ciri was born in Skellige in Belleteyn of the following year and initially, 
                            Calanthe ordered her advisor Mousesack to kill Geralt, wishing to break free from the Law of Surprise.

                            Triss Merigold of Maribor was a legendary Temerian sorceress of the 13th century. 
                            Called Fourteenth of the Hill by her contemporaries because she was erroneously thought to have been killed during the Battle of Sodden Hill, 
                            she passed into history as Merigold the Fearless. A member of King Foltest's royal council along with Fercart and Keira Metz, 
                            as well as a founding member of the Lodge of Sorceresses, she was involved in politics for most of her life.
                            <br><br>
                            She was friends with Yennefer and the witcher Geralt of Rivia, but also unhappily in love with the latter. 
                            Triss took care of Ciri at Kaer Morhen for some time and is like an older sister to her. 
                            It was through her intervention that Ciri was not subjected to harmful hormone changes at Kaer Morhen, stripping her of her secondary gender traits.

                          <p>Julian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount de Lettenhove, better known as Dandelion, was a poet, minstrel, bard, and close friend of Geralt of Rivia.
                            <br><br>
                            Not much is known about Dandelion's family except that he was of noble birth and was a cousin of Ferrant de Lettenhove, the royal instigator of Kerack.
                            He received his early education in a temple school, where, according to Geralt, 
                            literacy was "beaten into him with a cane". However, he didn't truly get into poetry until he was 19, 
                            after being inspired by his love for Countess de Stael. 
                            Dandelion studied the seven liberal arts for four years at Oxenfurt University before later becoming a professor, 
                            but only taught students for a year before leaving the academy to travel the world. He would, however, visit Oxenfurt from time to time to give guest lectures.

                            Emhyr var Emreis, Deithwen Addan yn Carn aep Morvudd, also known to a few under his alias as Duny, 
                            the Urcheon of Erlenwald (Polish: Jeż z Erlenwaldu) was Emperor of the Nilfgaardian Empire, Lord of Metinna, Ebbing, Gemmera, 
                            and Sovereign of Nazair and Vicovaro from 1257 until his death sometime in the late 13th century. He also became the King of Cintra after marrying a false Cirilla in 1268.
                            <br><br>
                            His rule of Nilfgaard was highly aggressive, often pursuing expansionist policies similar to those of his predecessors. 
                            This led to the outbreak of two wars against the Northern Kingdoms, both of which he lost. 
                            Emhyr var Emreis was an intelligent and brilliant ruler. He chose his people well and crushed many plots against him. 
                            He was ruthless toward traitors and moved towards his goals with great determination.
